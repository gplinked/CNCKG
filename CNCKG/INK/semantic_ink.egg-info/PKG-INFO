        INK is a binary data structure for representing a knowledge graph (KG), taking into account nodes and their neighbourhoods till a certain, specified depth.
        
        This repository contains:
        * The code to transform a KG into the binary INK matrix representation
        * The code INK Miner code: Semantic rule mining on the INK representation for both task-specific and task-agnostic use cases.
        
        ## Installation
        * `pip install https://github.com/IBCNServices/INK`
        * or clone this repository
        ## Usage
        See the [example notebook](https://github.com/IBCNServices/INK/blob/master/example.ipynb) for more information on how to use INK and the INK miner.<br>
        The latest documentation is made available by [Read the Docs](https://ink.readthedocs.io/)
